<h1>We As Humans Will Be Obsolete</h1>
	<h2>By Evan Mercado</h2>
		<img src="http://amicobracelets.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Future-of-Technology.gif">
			<p>The whole film was about how robots are soon going to take what jobs we do now. Starting with lower jobs but soon might take bigger jobs such as transportation which takes up most of the populations work force. The video also explained how robots already have taken</p>
			<p>In my  opinion, I feel sooner or later I won't have job to go to. That after all the dust has settled and more robots are made jobs will be done more efficiently. Humans will become obsolete.</p>

	<h2>Smile while on Snap</h3>
			<p>Even though we may think that we’re private and secured, that’s never really the case. The advanced cameras we have on our phones can help us just as much as it can hurt us. One wrong thing could land us in jail or get us kidnapped.</p>
			<p>In my opinion, this is terrifying . It makes me wanna stop using every electronic I use but at the same time it could help in many ways if I'm taken.</p>

	<h2>Knowing where you are</h3>
			<p>Even when you believe that location is off, there are ways to track your device. This means that with our phones on us, someone can track where we are.</p>
			<p> I have my own secrets as do you. I can't have the FBI on my back even if my locations are off. </p>

	<h2>Tracing paper</h3>
			<p>Even when doing things “the old fashioned way”, people are able to analyze it and figure out who printed it. Basically, thanks to modern technology, you are never 100% anonymous in your day to day life.</p>
			<p>Everyone is entitled to privacy but if you know the right hacks anything can be dug up and that's scary. This day and age nothing is 100% hidden.</p>

<h3>Interview with Mom</h3>
	 


			<p>Name: Catherine Cosme</p>
			<p>Relationship: Mother</p>

	<p>Evan: How old were you when you got your first computer?</p>
	<p>Cathy: Never had one growing up to be honest.</p>
	<p>Evan: What's your favorite piece of techology when you were growing up?</p>
	<p>Cathy: Favorite piece of technology would be the N64.</p>
	<p>Evan: How has technology changed over your lifetime?</p>
	<p>Cathy: It's definately advanced faster than we could ever imagined.
	<p>Evan:Have the changes you’ve seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</p>
	<p>Cathy: I think it's mostly hurt us. Today people can't go five minutes without needing to check their phones or use a device.</p>
	<p>Evan:What's your greatest fear and hope for tech?</p>
	<p>Cathy: My greatest fear would probably be robots taking over. And my greatest hope would be to use technology to find cures to stuff like cancer and AIDs to stop people from suffering.</p>
	<p>Evan:What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology?</p>
	<p>Cathy: You don't need technology to survive. A little human interaction every now and then won't kill you. Doing stuff without the help of a device isn't as bad as it may seem to be it's .</p>
